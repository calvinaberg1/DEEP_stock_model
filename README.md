# DEEP_stock_model
2021 DEEP stock price prediction model
## Overview
This project was part of a semester long competition and exploration project with Rice Data Science called DEEP (data education and exploration project). Working in a team of two with a mentor, we had weekly sessions in which we walked through every step of the data science pipeline with our data - historical stock price data. In the end of the semester, we were able to create a prediction model using neural networks and [present our model to a panel of judges.](https://github.com/calvinaberg1/DEEP_stock_model/blob/main/Calvin%20Aberg%20-%20DEEP%20Final%20Presentation.pptx?raw=true) 

*The skills and models that we utilized were:*
- Group communication
- Visualization
- Time Series Prediction
- ARIMA Prediction Model
- LSTM Prediction Model
